This is the public code repository for my STEM fair project "Building Palaces: Neural Network Target Architecture on Total Revenue".  
It should contain all necessary scripts pertaining to the actual topic, but there might be some missing ones, especially with data retrieval and formatting.  

I'm not too familiar with GitHub, so apologies for any errors or accidental omissions ðŸ˜…
I'll be releasing a more organized version (that hopefully includes LNNs) by Monday, March 24. Will be adding diversification and actual integration... eventually.
